How to see the difference quickly
1) Start server
uvicorn main:app --reload

2) In Terminal A: run a long call
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/async-io?delay_s=10"

3) Immediately in Terminal B: run another call

Try each of these and observe whether it returns quickly or “waits behind” the first request.

curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/async-io?delay_s=1"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/sync-blocking?delay_s=1"
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/bg-email?to=test@example.com&delay_s=5"

/async-io: second request usually responds quickly even while the 10s one is waiting (good concurrency for I/O).
/sync-blocking: still works concurrently, but each request consumes a thread; under heavy load it degrades sooner.
/bg-email: responds immediately; the “work” happens after response (watch console logs).
